# Background
An ideal digital twin is a database that we can access that allows us to know the current exact state of these areas to a level that we can use the database for real-time decision making. In our work, we are focused on driving, but the technology we are developing could be applied to just about any system or situation: a manufacturing plant, a shopping mall, or a power grid.

Digital twins involve three aspects:

- Measuring data from the real world and updating the digital twin, for example by pushing data into the database
- Evolving data in the digital twin in a manner consistent with reality, e.g. removing old data from the database as appropriate
- Predicting the data in the digital twin, particularly for visualizations and virtual interactions such as simulations.

Example digital twin information includes: A. The boundaries (e.g., what are the "borders" of the area in latitude, longitude, elevation - how do we define the perimeter?) B. The topology (e.g. what is the "surface" of the area? How do we define the mesh we are driving on?) C. The features within the area (lane markers, obstacles, images of the road surface, signs and other "decorators") D. Features external to the area that are far away, but affect the perception of reality (view of surrounding mountains, view of the sky, etc.) E. Actors within the digital twin (e.g. the vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signals).

# Goal

Our goal is to develop the technologies to support a "digital twin" of physical systems such that experiments and analyses in one domain can allow analysis in the other domain. Among the simplest systems to study are roads: they have well-defined rules of operation (physics, traffic laws, etc.), a finite number of acting objects (the number of cars within a space are limited and small in number), small numbers of inputs (traffic signals, and a very few driver inputs to each car), and roads and vehicles have profound safety impacts to society.
